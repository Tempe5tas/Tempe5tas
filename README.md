### Hi there 👋
Here's Tempest, a normal graduate. Currently looking for a job.

- I'm currently learning more about the Go programming language.
- I like wargame🔫 / music games🎮 / PC hardware assembling🖥 (and exploring new things/techniques🔬).

Be free to ask me about anything [here](https://github.com/Tempe5tas/Tempe5tas/issues).

You can communicate with me in Chinese or English.
