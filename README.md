## Hi there 👋
Here's Tempest, a normal graduate. Currently working as a technical support specialist.

### Technical abilities
- Due to the nature of my work, I am currently learning operation and maintenance knowledge.
- I'm learning more about Go programming language after work.

### Daily life
- Planning to involve into [HEMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_European_martial_arts)🗡 after my probation period (if passed).
- I like wargame🔫 / music games🎮 / PC hardware assembling🖥 (and exploring new things/techniques🔬).

Be free to ask me about anything [here](https://github.com/Tempe5tas/Tempe5tas/issues).

You can communicate with me in Chinese or English.
